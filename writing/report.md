## Progress Update (due on October 29 by 11:30am)

So far, I created a movie and TV show data set. Additionally, I collected and stored all the plot and synopsis for each movie and show. They are ready for the next steps which is preprocessing. I'm a little behind on the schedule but I'm planning to catch up as soon as I can.

## Data

The data used to train the ai model is the synopsis of hand selected movies and
shows. A list of the movies and shows can be found in the `dataset.yaml` file.
The items were selected based on it's genre, if a movie or a show contained
sci-fi elements such as robots, ai, time travel or other futuristic concept,
then it was included in the list. Once the list was created, I used
[IMDbPY](https://imdbpy.github.io/) to make requests and get the synopsis to
each data item. For each item the database returned multiple synopsis that were
phrased somewhat differently. All of them were kept for the purposes of training
the model. Additionally, for tv shows, the data miner iterated through every
season and episode of the show and retrieved the individual synopsis of each episode.

## Text Generation

TODO:
Describe the techniques used for an automated generation of your script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include your generated text (or its snippet) below.

## Text Analysis

TODO:
Describe the techniques used for an automated text analysis of your automated script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include a graph or textual output of your analysis. Include your output below.

## Experimental Analysis

TODO:
Describe the experiments you conducted to evaluate text generation and text analysis.

## Supplemental Production

TODO:
Describe the supplemental production you have created. Include an image if relevant.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO:
Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and  describe what have you learned.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

TODO:
If you are unable to discern specific themes related to future technology use from your synopsis, provide a manually edited version of your synopsis below.

```
(Optional) Modified Synopsis
```

Then, hypothesizing on the issues highlighted in your generated (or modified) text, answer the following questions.

1. What future technology is featured in your synopsis?

2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?

3. What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology?

4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?

5. What is their story?

6. Now, consider what benefit can come out of the  technology featured in the story and how can we work towards preventing the negative consequences of the future they envision?
